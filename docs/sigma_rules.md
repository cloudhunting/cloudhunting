# What Are Sigma Rules?
Sigma rules are YAML-written textual signatures designed to identify suspicious activity over log events which making them useful for creating incident response detection or automated responses. One of the main advantages of these rules is their standardized format, which allows them to be written once and applied across various SIEM products without needing to rewrite the rule. However, Sigma rules still need to be written which can take time and effort to build the appropriate rule for a specific case and avoid false-positives.

Using **CloudHunting** you will find a varity collection of pre-built Sigma rules that have been specifically designed to detect common cloud-based attack techniques, as well as misconfigurations that could leave organizations vulnerable to attack. The rules mapped by the MITRE ATT&CK Cloud framework techniques with the intent to cover a wide range of scenarios, including common attack techniques, such as lateral movement and privilege escalation, as well as more specific misconfigurations and attack vectors that are unique to cloud environments.
