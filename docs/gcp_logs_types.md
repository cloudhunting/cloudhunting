GCP provides several types of logs to help you monitor and troubleshoot your GCP resources, as well as enhance security.
By leveraging these logs, you can have a comprehensive security visibility and monitoring to detect and respond to potential security threats.

## Cloud Audit Logs
These logs provide a comprehensive record of all API calls made on your GCP account, including information such as the identity of the caller, the time of the call, the request parameters, and the response elements. They can be used to track user actions, detect and investigate security incidents, and ensure compliance with security policies.

## Cloud Security Command Center (CSCC) Logs
These logs provide security findings from CSCC, a security management service that helps you identify and respond to potential security threats in your GCP environment. It can be used to detect and investigate security incidents, track the status of security alerts, and identify trends in your security posture.

## Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) Logs
These logs provide a record of all IAM-related events, such as user sign-in and sign-out, as well as changes to roles and permissions. They can be used to track user actions, detect and investigate security incidents, and ensure compliance with security policies.

## Cloud Data Loss Prevention (DLP) Logs
These logs provide information about DLP findings and actions, such as sensitive data detection, data masking, and de-identification. They can be used to detect and protect sensitive data, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, and monitor data access.

## Stackdriver Logging
This is a powerful logging service that allows you to store, search, analyze, and alert on log data and events from GCP and other cloud resources. It can be used to monitor system and application logs, identify potential security risks, and troubleshoot security issues.

## Stackdriver Trace 
This service allows you to collect and analyze latency data from your applications, to help you identify and resolve performance issues. It can also be used to monitor network traffic patterns and identify potential security risks.
