# Mapping CloudHunting Sigma Rules by MITRE ATT&CK Cloud Framework
The mapping of Sigma rules with the MITRE ATT&CK cloud framework is a new and exclusive feature offered by "CloudHunting." It allows organizations and cyber defenders to effectively hunt for threats and misconfigurations in their cloud environments by focus their attention on the areas that are most critical and susceptible to attacks. Additionally, it provides an efficient way to assess the organization current security posture and identify areas where they can improve. This, in turn, can help to prioritize security measures and improve the efficiency of their security operations, leading to increased protection against cyber threats and a more secure cloud environment.

The combination of Sigma rules and the mapping to the MITRE ATT&CK cloud framework makes "CloudHunting" a valuable tool for organizations looking to enhance their cloud security posture and stay ahead of the curve with up-to-date protection against the latest threats and misconfigurations in the cloud.
