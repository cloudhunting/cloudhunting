## Introduction
CloudHunting is an open-source community-driven website that provides methods and techniques for hunting threats and misconfigurations in cloud environments. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive and effective solution for organizations and cyber defenders to detect, respond and protect against the growing threat landscape in the cloud.
Our framework leverages the power of Sigma Rules, a standardized format for writing signatures to identify suspicious activity and anomalies in log events, and maps them to the techniques outlined in the MITRE ATT&CK cloud framework. This integration allows us to offer a unique and up-to-date coverage of common attack techniques, misconfigurations, and attack vectors that are specific to cloud environments.

At CloudHunting, we believe that the best way to stay ahead of threats is to collaborate and share knowledge. That's why our framework is open-source and community-driven, allowing security professionals to contribute and share their expertise with the wider community. We are proud to make it available as an open-source project and welcome contributions from the community.

Thanks for visiting, and happy hunting!
