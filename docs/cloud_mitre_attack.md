The MITRE ATT&CK Cloud framework is an extension of the widely-used MITRE ATT&CK framework, specifically tailored for cloud environments. It provides a comprehensive understanding of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by cyber threats in cloud environments, enabling security professionals to more effectively identify and respond to potential threats. It includes new techniques and tactics that have emerged as a result of the widespread adoption of cloud services and infrastructure.

The Cloud framework is divided into several categories, each representing a different stage of the attack life-cycle.
